      Hello , I am a junior python developer, and I really want to join your
      team and help you archive you projects. I can work even 30hours a week if
      that could help you go up in your projects. I'm available for fully remote
      job. Just give a date and I'll be here for a meetup not only once a week.
      As I said my goal is to help. I'm ready to do everything I can do to
      really help. My main programming language is python, and their framework
      for web developpement ( django ), but i'm also good in vue3 as well and my
      computer is on ubuntu. Working with you will help me learn and improve my
      skills in django, vue and github. Hope your project will be listed in my
      private repositories.
